Number Of Paths In A Matrix



Determine the number of distinct paths to reach from (0, 0) to (n - 1, m - 1) going through only open cells (cells containing 1) and moving only right or down.





For the above example, there are two possible paths from the cell (0, 0) to cell (1, 3) in this matrix. Complete the function numberOfPaths. The function must return the number of paths through the matrix, modulo (10^9 + 7).
